## Core Tenets

#### _for people_

---

* Anyone who can read and write English is fully capable of learning how to produce enterprise-grade software capable of meeting [OpenSSF Standards](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en).

* Nobody knows what they do not know.

* Every idea anyone has ever had about how to do something they do _not know_ that _will_ work is _still_ a good idea.

    * Even and _especially_ if you _know_ of a better one.

#### _for python_

---

* When it comes to `ft3`, if something can be accomplished many different ways, always prefer:  `__special_method__ > public_method > _private_method`


### Practical Implications

If someone is asking a question that is patently misguided, it is incumbent upon you (the ostensibly erudite responder) to:

1. Draw from your own experience as a former denizen of [Plato's Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave) (even if you have to think a long time back) to understand _why_ the asker is taking the approach they are.
2. Recall the core tenets listed above and remember that:
    * No one will ever be less encouraged to learn from wisdom than when it is delivered in such a way that makes the recipient question a broader competency about themselves.
    * No one has ever questioned their personal competency when told their first idea is _still_ a good idea.
    * That your idea is better is never clearer to someone else than when it already explicitly states all the good things about theirs.
3. Respond in such a way that makes it clear _why_ it will actually benefit the asker to [make the proverbial 4-inch mirror before the 6-inch mirror](https://wiki.c2.com/?TelescopeRule).


### Codified Rules

In turn, the following rules apply to all forms of communication (issues, pull requests, discussions, etc.) concerning this project. This may include the content of private messages as well, if presented to contributors and deemed relevant.

So, if you are interested in contributing or otherwise communicating with contributors... expect otherwise if you do not adhere to the below:

1. Don't be an asshole.
2. You don't get to be the judge of whether or not _you_ are being an asshole.


### Enforcement

Depending on the severity of the infraction / maturity of the response of the person found to be in violation of the rules, punishment may range from accepting an apology to indefinite suspension of the user's access to official project communication and / or contribution channels.
